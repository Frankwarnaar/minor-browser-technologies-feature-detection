# Feature detection

In this project I researched some features in HTML, CSS and Javascript. My goal was to figure out what happened when features are not supported in browsers, in which browsers they don't work and how you can solve problems.

## HTML

### [Details element](https://frankwarnaar.github.io/minor-browser-technologies-feature-detection/features/details.html)
The details element makes it possible to make a block collapsable with plain html.

#### Syntax
```HTML
<details>
	<summary>Click me</summary>
	<p>Now you can see some more content!</p>
</details>
```
